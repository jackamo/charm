Goals:
- make it easy to reason about and create complex layouts of graphics - nested groups, weird alignment, etc.
- immediate mode - graphics can react to changes in the game state without manual effort
- low memory usage
- make it easy to write additional element classes for when the included graphics primitives don't cut it
	- custom elements should be able to draw graphics directly or make other elements
